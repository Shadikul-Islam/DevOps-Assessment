## <a name="01">Introduction</a>

In today's fast-paced e-commerce world, the need for efficient and scalable solutions is paramount. This will focus on designing an e-commerce architecture using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to replace an outdated system. The goal is to improve efficiency, performance, and customer satisfaction. We'll also estimate the costs of running this architecture to accommodate traffic of 20,000 to 30,000 requests per second. By leveraging AWS services, we aim to create a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution that aligns with the demands of modern e-commerce. This architecture provides a practical understanding of cloud architecture and cost estimation in the context of real-world business challenges.

In this document, I will elucidate the architectural design utilizing AWS services alongside open-source tools. This approach serves the purpose of offering a blueprint that demonstrates how the same architecture can be constructed both within the AWS ecosystem and alternatively, leveraging open-source solutions without incurring additional costs. This comparative analysis allows for a comprehensive understanding of the flexibility and cost-efficiency available in deploying similar architectures.

### Web Application

**Using AWS Services:**

**Amazon EC2 Instances:** We can use multiple EC2 instances running the web application code. These instances should be distributed across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.

**Auto Scaling:** Set up an Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on traffic load.

**Using Open Source Tools:**

**Web Server:** We can use open-source web servers like Nginx or Apache to host the e-commerce website. We can deploy them on an AWS EC2 Instance or any virtual machines or dedicated servers.

**Application Framework:** We can build our application from scratch using any preferred programming language and also we can choose a web application framework such as Magento, WooCommerce (WordPress), or OpenCart for building the e-commerce site.


### Database

**Using AWS Services:**

**Amazon RDS for MySQL:** We can use Amazon RDS for the relational database by enabling Multi-AZ deployments for high availability and automated failover.

**Using Open Source Tools:**

**MySQL or PostgreSQL:** We can also use open-source relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL for storing product information, customer data, and order history.

### Caching

**Using AWS Services:**

**Amazon ElastiCache:** We can implement Amazon ElastiCache (Redis or Memcached) for caching frequently accessed data, such as product listings and session data, to reduce the load on the database and improve performance.

**Using Open Source Tools:**

**Redis:** We can also implement open-source caching solutions like Redis to cache frequently accessed data for faster response times.

### Data Storage

**Using AWS Services:**

**Amazon S3:** Store and serve static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) from Amazon S3. Enable S3 standard for durable and scalable object storage.

**DynamoDB:** Use DynamoDB's on-demand capacity for storing high-traffic, low-latency data, such as user sessions and shopping carts.

**Using Open Source Tools:**

**Local File Storage:** Store static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) on local file storage or network-attached storage (NAS).

### Load Balancing

**Using AWS Services:**

**Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Set up an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic among multiple EC2 instances for load balancing.

**Using Open Source Tools:**

**Nginx:** Use open-source load balancers Nginx to distribute incoming traffic among multiple web servers. Nginx acts as a reverse proxy, securing, load balancing, and streamlining server management between clients and backends. Additionally, its caching capabilities boost website performance by storing commonly accessed content, reducing server load, and enhancing user experience. It is an essential tool for web application optimization.

### Security and Identity

**Using AWS Services:**

**IAM:** Create IAM users and roles for role management and secure access to AWS resources.

**AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement WAF to protect against web application attacks.

**Amazon Cognito:** Use Amazon Cognito for user authentication and secure access control.

**AWS KMS:** Manage encryption keys with AWS Key Management Service to ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

**Using Open Source Tools:**

**ModSecurity and Fail2Ban:** We can deploy security tools like ModSecurity (Web Application Firewall) and Fail2Ban for protection against web application attacks and intrusion attempts. For protecting web applications, ModSecurity is the best choice. For broader security and system-level protection, Fail2Ban is the best.

**LDAP:** We can use LDAP for internal user authentication and access control within the organization.

### Monitoring and Analytics

**Using AWS Services:**

**Amazon CloudWatch:** Monitor resource utilization, set up alarms for scaling, and collect logs for analysis.

**AWS Lambda:** Use Lambda functions for custom metrics and monitoring tasks.

**Amazon CloudFront:** Integrate Amazon CloudFront as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for faster content delivery and caching.

**Using Open Source Tools:**

**Prometheus and Grafana:** We can use Prometheus for monitoring metrics and Grafana for visualization and alerting.

**ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):** To collect and analyze logs from the web servers and applications for troubleshooting and security monitoring, we can use it.

### Email Service

**Using AWS Services:**

**Amazon SES:** Integrate Amazon SES for sending transactional emails to customers with a responsive email design.

**Using Open Source Tools:**

**Postfix and open-source email libraries:** We can set up our email server using Postfix and integrate open-source email libraries for sending transactional emails with responsive designs. We can use these email libraries MJML (Mailjet Markup Language) and Nodemailer for good designs.

### Backup and Recovery

**Using AWS Services:**

**Amazon EBS Snapshots (Elastic Block Store):** For backup and recovery of block storage volumes used with EC2 instances, Amazon EBS provides snapshot capabilities. Snapshots allow us to capture a point-in-time copy of our EBS volumes.

**AWS Backup:** AWS Backup is a centralized backup service that simplifies the process of backing up data from various AWS services, such as EC2, RDS, and EFS. It offers a unified management interface for creating and managing backups.

**Amazon RDS Automated Backups:** Amazon RDS for our RDS databases, comes with automated backup features. We can enable automated daily backups and maintain a specified retention period.

**Using Open Source Tools:**

**Rsync and Duplicity:** Rsync is an open-source tool that efficiently synchronizes and backs up files and directories. And Duplicity supports encryption and incremental backups.

**Rsnapshot:** Rsnapshot is an open-source filesystem snapshot utility based on rsync, making it suitable for scheduled backups.

### High Availability

**Using AWS Services:**

- We need to use multiple Availability Zones for EC2 instances, RDS, and other critical services to ensure redundancy.

**Using Open Source Tools:**

- We can use replication and clustering for databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL to ensure high availability.
 -We can deploy web servers and load balancers across multiple physical locations or data centers for redundancy.
